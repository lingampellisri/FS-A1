/*
Tata motors released a new ELECTRIC CAR, which recharges its battery 
based on the vehicle movement at specific points along the road when vehicle passes 
those points at a specified speed. 
As you are the owner of that CAR, you want to get maximum benefit of that, 
and you are travelling on a road of length "N" kilometres. 

There are specific recharge points at every kilometre, 
it specifies how much percentage of battery improves when you pass those points with a specified speed. 
But you can travel with this specified speed for a continuous distance of "K" kilometres. 
With your programming skills can you determine how to maximize the benefit from this.


Input Format:
-------------
Line-1: Two space-separated integers N and K, the length of the track and the maximum distance car can run at specified speed.
Line-2: N space-separated integers, the number of charging points within each kilometre of the road.

Output Format:
-------------
Line-1: an integer.


Sample Input-1:
---------------
7 2
2 4 8 1 2 1 8

Sample Output-1:
----------------
12

Explanation:
Car can get maximum recharge 4+8=12 if it runs at specified speed between the 2nd and the 3rd kilometre, inclusive.

Constraints 
-----------
-> 1≤T≤10
-> 1≤K≤N≤100
-> 1≤ai≤100
